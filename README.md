# Second Assignment of Distributed Systems
In this repository, can be found the source code of programs which focus on multithreaded processes and serialization of critic regions; all programs were written using C. 
- ex1.c implements an atomic lock to serialize critic regions;
- ex2.c uses semaphores to serialize critic regions in a number of threads in a producer-consumer dynamic.
## Running
You can execute the poject using:
